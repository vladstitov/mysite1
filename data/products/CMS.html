    Best Content Management System does not need a Manual
    Avoid mistakes and self explanatory interface
    Content management and  edit application configuration is very responsible and time consuming work. We know that and our software aimed to avoid confusion and learning curve.
    User interfaces for data management equipt with input validation, raw preview or we give to administrator full front end view with live editing capability.
    Changes will not apply until approved but admin can see right away affected changes what he/she have made. Color theme, banner, background, text editing and many others features can be edit on a Backend in exactly same  interface what Frontend has. Administrator can have feel and look of Frontend after changes will apply.
    For corporations we provide role based data access with changes notifications, approvement, history and revert capabilities.
