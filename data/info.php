                    In our research, we've seen that Javascript is a great tool for displaying a web application's user workflow. With HTML, users typically must access multiple screens to complete a web application process,
                </p>
                <p class="hidden">
                    with little to no control over the order of these steps. With Javascript, developers can display all of the users' necessary steps on a single screen, giving users a "big picture" view of their workflow.
                    To illustrate, Volkswagen's web site lets users configure their own car using the function implemented in HTML. Users can specify the type of engine, the color of the car's exterior and interior, and optional features.

                    To configure a car, the interface requires users to click through five different screens. The problem is that users can't see how many steps are ahead of them. Users also don't know if they can easily go back and change their specifications. Choosing an interior trim that costs extra might be acceptable early in the process, but when a more preferable option comes later, users may want to change their interior again to reduce costs.

                    With the HTML application, users cannot tell if changing preferences will be a simple process or not, thus adding an element of uncertainty to the experience and increasing their chances that they will not complete the transaction.

                    In contrast, the developers of Volkswagen's Asia Pacific application created aÂ car configuratorimplemented in Javascript. The configurator matches the functionality of the HTML implementation, but it lets users choose all specifications on one screen. As a result, users can drag and drop their specifications into a template to immediately see the results of their actions.

                    (We do recognize that pure javascript-based application is not perfect. If we tested this application, we would expect to see some users exhibit problems with the design's novel interface. However, it does a good job of demonstrating Javascript ability to display an entire user workflow on one screen, something not possible in HTML.)

                    In addition to the entire process being accessible on one screen, users get immediate responses to their specifications, without having to wait for new pages to load.

                   Having a flexible application workflow also allows users to zoom into the features that are most important to them first.
                   Imagine you want to revise your life insurance policy, but only want to change your beneficiary information.
               </p>
                <p class="hidden" >Imagine you want to revise your life insurance policy, but only want to change your beneficiary information. In an HTML form, you may not be able to access the beneficiary data until five screens into the process. Using Javascript, developers can easily build flexible applications that let users attack the process in their own order.

                    To illustrate, Design Center's applicationÂ lets users build their own product on one screen. Users can design their own kitchen by choosing the type of faucet and the colors of the sink, countertop, cabinets, walls and windows.

                    In addition to viewing the entire workflow on one screen, users have control over the order they specify preferences, something not easy to implement in HTML. As soon as users specify the criteria, the visual display reflects their choices.

                    While there are ways to create the Moen implementation with JavaScript and HTML, it's very clumsy and involves a great deal of download time. It would require a JavaScript function that replaces one image, or choice, with another, based on the colors selected. For Moen's developers to do this with JavaScript, they would need a separate picture of the kitchen with every possible color/sink combination. This becomes very difficult for developers to manage.

                    Similarly,Â Timbuk2's applicationÂ lets customers build their own messenger bag with control over the workflow. Users can specify the size, material, color, and other features they want in a custom-made messenger bag.

                    When buying a messenger bag, not all content is equal to users. For example, some people who are price sensitive may want to jump across criteria, changing the size and color of the messenger bag to make quick cost comparisons. Javascript enables designs to have a flexible workflow, allowing users to zoom into the features that are most important to them first.

                    This article just scratches the surface of what is now possible using Javascript to create web applications. Javascript leading-edge capabilities for creating powerful interfaces and graphical displays are the first components in a new wave of web applications. We're confident that with the use of Javascript, it will be possible for developers to move far beyond the functionality possible with traditional HTML-based applications</p>
