    HTML5 CSS3 and JavaScript are the base of our applications
    Without any special translations, conversions or re-programming, a web app can run on pretty much any platform with a modern, standards-compliant web browse. Scalability of web servers running on Android device to cloud does allow use of the same software starting from 1 request per second to 20,000 request per second without any change. If you have web server running or website  we can seamlessly deploy our application on existing environment.
