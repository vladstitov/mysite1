    Having a flexible application workflow also allows users to zoom into the features that are most important to them first.
    Imagine you want to revise your life insurance policy, but only want to change your beneficiary information. In traditional form, you may not be able to access the beneficiary data until five screens into the process. Using Application engine, developers can easily build flexible screens that let users have the process in their own order.
    To illustrate, Design application  lets users build their own product on one screen. Users can design their own kitchen by choosing the type of faucet and the colors of the sink, countertop, cabinets, walls and windows.

    Lets customers build their own messenger bag with control over the workflow. Users can specify the size, material, color, and other features they want in a custom-made messenger bag.
    When buying a messenger bag, not all content is equal to users. For example, some people who are price sensitive may want to jump across criteria, changing the size and color of the messenger bag to make quick cost comparisons. Javascript enables designs to have a flexible workflow, allowing users to zoom into the features that are most important to them first.
    Javascript leading-edge capabilities for creating powerful interfaces and graphical displays are the first components in a new wave
