<h3>
    Displaying the Big Picture

</h3>
<p>
    In our research, we've seen that Javascript is a great tool for displaying a web application's user workflow. With pure HTML, users typically must access multiple screens to complete a web application process, with little to no control over the order of these steps. With Javascript, developers can display all of the user' necessary steps on a single screen, giving users a "big picture" view of their workflow.

    Using builtin into browser User Interface and ajax connectivity data floats between device and main frame delivering requested information from life taken sources. All complexity staying on a background giving to consumer well designed view with animations and color theme to accomplish feel and look of displayed data.

    connected to cloud solution bringing full power of world created networking artificial intelligence.




    New generation of 3D computer graphics opened a huge range of programing skills implementation in design of real world and can be used for visualisation and process understanding
    Javascript is a powerful tool that offers developers huge capabilities. Until recently, developers mostly utilized Flash's strengths to create complex animations or fast-loading movies. However, HTML5 offer developers power that's far beyond the tool's original scope.

    With the advent of Javascript developers have the power to create web applications with more sophisticated client- and server-side interactivity. When integrated with sophisticated server-side software like PHP and JAVA delivers the power and flexibility to become a serious contender in the web space.
    Traditional HTML often involve users completing a process, or a series of steps to get something done. Among HTML5 greatest strengths, we've seen that it offers users the ability to view all of the steps in the process in one visual display. Javascript also enables users to attack the application steps in their own order. These strengths dramatically enhance the user experience by giving users control and understanding of an application.

    To illustrate, auto web site lets users configure their own car using the function implemented in HTML. Users can specify the type of engine, the color of the car's exterior and interior, and optional features.

    The configuration matches the functionality of sales and it lets users choose all specifications on one screen. As a result, users can drag and drop their specifications into a template to immediately see the results of their actions.
    In addition to the entire process being recorded and stored in database for future analysis.
